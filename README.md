# Welcome!

Between November 2015 and June 2016, the Hive NYC Community Coordinator, in collaboration with the Network Manager, spearheaded a set of projects designed to streamline communications and track member engagement.
 
We have documented projects the listed below for the benefit of current and future Hive NYC staff and in the spirit of [Working Open](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Working_open), which is core to the mission of [Mozilla Foundation](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/about/).

1. Membership Database
2. Community Map
3. 'Round-up Robot'
4. Analytics

All of the resources for these projects are in this [GDrive Folder](https://drive.google.com/a/mozilla.com/folderview?id=0B5ga06pZVp55b2VjUVdOamlMTk0&usp=sharing), which is only accessible to Mozilla staff.

###Everyone is invited to learn more [here](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/HiveNYC/wiki).
