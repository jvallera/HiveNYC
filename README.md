# Welcome!

Between November 2015 and June 2016, the Hive NYC Community Coordinator, in collaboration with the Network Manager, spearheaded the projects list below. These interrelated projects are designed to streamline communications and track member engagement.

1. Membership Database
2. Community Map
3. 'Round-up Robot'
4. Analytics Dashboard
 
We are making our efforts public for the benefit of current and future Hive NYC staff and in the spirit of [Working Open](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Working_open), which is core to the mission of [Mozilla Foundation](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/about/).



All of the resources for these projects are in this [GDrive Folder](https://drive.google.com/a/mozilla.com/folderview?id=0B5ga06pZVp55b2VjUVdOamlMTk0&usp=sharing), which is only accessible to Mozilla staff.

###Everyone is invited to learn more [here](https://github.com/jvallera/HiveNYC/wiki).
